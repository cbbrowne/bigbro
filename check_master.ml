Applying mappings to the specified (absolute) URL. A mapping is a pair of regular expression and a replacement string
(which is allowed to contain $1, $2, etc.). This should be a very flexible mechanism.

is an applicable input of some other mapping - something we don't recommend.

Determining whether a link is in the check cache.

A "task" here is not just determined by a URL - it is a pair of a URL and a retrieval flag, because depending
on the value of the flag, these are two different checks. (If the retrieval flag is set, the task involves retrieving
the text and analyzing its fragments; otherwise, it only involves checking the document's existence.)

This function is called before actually starting a task - first, we check whether the same task has been done
before. There are several possibilities:

- The task has been run and the outcome is available from the cache.
  We re-use the previous outcome and return true.
- The task has been seen before but is not done.
  We add the current task to the waiting room and return true.
- The task has never been seen before.
  We add the current task to the waiting room and return false.

If the result is false, then the caller knows that the task actually has to be performed.

While checking the cache, we use the unmapped URL, because it is one that describes the "logical" document. It would
be possible for several URLs to be mapped to the same physical document, and in that case, we must check it twice,
because the base URLs will differ.

It might be possible for a given URL to be checked twice - once in non-recursive mode and once in recursive mode - but
this shouldn't happen often, if at all.

This function checks a link for which a full info structure is not yet available. The link can come from a piece of
HTML text or from the command line. A regular info structure is expected.

Arguments:
- A reference to the base URL. The function can update this URL if the link is a <BASE HREF> specification.
- A document source, if available. Used to create the full link info structure.
- Recursion settings. Used to force initial links to be recursively followed.
- An optional local base URL (in textual form), coming from the same tag (APPLET/OBJECT tags).
- The link info structure.
