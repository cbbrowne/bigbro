Hello! This file contains a few short instructions explaining
how to display Big Brother's documentation.

The documentation files should be located within the same
directory as this README file. The files are:

  html/doc.htm

  The documentation, in HTML format. This is probably the best
  format for online reference. View it with any browser.

  doc.ps

  The documentation, in PostScript format. It should be easy to
  print on a PostScript printer (of course) and will provide you
  with a high-quality hardcopy. If you don't have any software to
  handle PostScript files, you can download Ghostscript from
	   http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html

  doc.pdf

  The documentation, in PDF format. The quality is just as good as
  with PostScript, and it can be viewed or printed with Adobe's
  Acrobat Reader. If you don't have this software, you can get it
  from
           http://www.adobe.com/

The PostScript and the PDF file are both in US Letter paper size,
but it should be possible to print them on A4 paper anyway. If you
have an A4 printer, I recommend printing the PDF file rather than
the PostScript file, because Acrobat seems to do a good job of
re-centering the text for an A4 sheet.

Have fun!
