Handle the Content-Base HTTP header.
Support for FTP protocol.
Allow following redirected links instead of/in addition to reporting them.

Support Netscape-ism <META HTTP-EQUIV="Refresh" CONTENT="30; URL=http://www.apple.com/documents/groups.html">

--- Documentation

Décrire toutes les erreurs possibles.
