<h2>What Big Brother is <em>not</em></h2>
<p>When a webmaster removes a document from his site, he can either remove it for good, or replace it with a page
containing a short explanatory message. Similarly, when he moves a document to a new location, he has a choice between
configuring his Web server to provide clients with the new address (this is called automatic redirection), or
replacing the document with a short page containing a link to the new location. In each of these two situations, if
the first choice is made, then Big Brother can identify that the document is missing or has moved and alert you about
it. If the second choice is made, there is no way for Big Brother to distinguish the explanatory message from the
expected document, so the error will remain undetected.</p>
<p>Besides, one should point out that Big Brother is not an HTML syntax checker. Its job is to verify links, and most
errors in your HTML documents will go unnoticed. This is a probably a good thing, since syntax checking is a difficult
task, and an entirely different job. Big Brother is very lenient and accepts anything that looks remotely like HTML
text.</p>
<p>Finally, Big Brother has a few limitations. The main one is that it does not support <code>ftp</code> links. This
problem might be remedied in a future version.</p>
