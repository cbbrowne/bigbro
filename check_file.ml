     There are several points to understand here. First, we are not concerned here with checking this specific URL's
     fragment. We are only interested in performing the document's fragment analysis if necessary. The actual check
     for this fragment shall be done later.

     Second, the fragment analysis is considered necessary only if the -fragments flag is set, and this URL carries
     a fragment, and this file hasn't been analyzed until now.

     Finally, one should note that if recursion is performed, then we will perform fragment analysis, even if the
     latter was found to be unnecessary. This ensures that files are only read/downloaded once. (If we did not do
     this, then we might read the file once to do recursion on a fragment-less URL, and later have to read it again
     because we find a fragment-carrying URL.) *)
